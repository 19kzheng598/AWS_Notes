RFC 1918 is a standard that defines
private IP address ranges for use within private networks,
which are not routable on the public Internet. 
The specified ranges are 
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255,
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, 
allowing organizations to use these addresses without needing to register them 
with an Internet registry.
